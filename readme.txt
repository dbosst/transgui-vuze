INSTALLATION

LINUX:

Easy way (recommended).

There are precompiled program's binaries for i386 and x86_64 Linux architectures.
- Download a .zip archive for your architecture.
- Unzip it to your home dir.
- Create a desktop or menu shortcut to the transgui executable.
  * (If needed, change the transgui file permissions to executable).
- Run the program using the created shortcut.

Harder way.

Build the program by yourself.
- Make sure you have working Lazarus and Free Pascal compiler installed.
  * Free Pascal Compiler 2.6.2 and Lazarus 1.0 is used to develop Transmission Remote GUI. You may use different versions of FPC and Lazarus at your own risk.
- Download the sources archive and extract it to some folder or perform svn checkout. 
- Open terminal/command line prompt and cd to the sources folder;
- Execute "make" command to build the application;
- Execute "make zipdist" command to create a release .zip archive in the "Release" sub-folder.

COMMAND LINE PARAMETERS

You can specify path to a .torrent file or a magnet link as a command line parameter. The program will add the specified torrent.

-hidden : Start the program hidden. Only the program's tray icon will be visible.
--home=<home_dir> : Specifies a home directory for the program. All program's settings are stored in the home directory. You can run multiple instances of the program by specifying different home directories.

PORTABLE MODE

If the program finds the transgui.ini file in the same folder as the binary file, then it will store all configuration and data files in the program's folder, instead of the folder in a user profile.

ADVANCED PARAMETERS

There are some parameters in the tramsgui.ini file, that can not be modified via the GUI.
